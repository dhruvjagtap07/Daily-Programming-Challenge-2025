## Questions 

### [Day 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13A4_Ao-rcPtBixXnsMMDuN4ByQTIwV3dWuxmbxoJryA/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given an array arr consisting only of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The task is to sort the array in increasing order 
in linear time (i.e., O(n)) without using any extra space. This means you need to rearrange the array in-place.
[**solution**](https://github.com/dhruvjagtap07/Daily-Programming-Challenge-2025/blob/main/Day1.cpp)

### [Day 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12_bbV-jW2RakUKA1C6yTllF_npjjmnTuyHHVSD5NVj8/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given an array arr containing n-1 distinct integers. The array consists of integers taken from the
range 1 to n, meaning one integer is missing from this sequence. Your task is to find the missing integer.
[**solution**](https://github.com/dhruvjagtap07/Daily-Programming-Challenge-2025/blob/main/Day2.cpp)

### [Day 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EjdgSLCZ8atJKF9HczIIikWPlg2fioRLqdE9lHlxd5M/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given an array arr containing n-1 distinct integers. The array consists of integers taken from the
range 1 to n, meaning one integer is missing from this sequence. Your task is to find the missing integer.
[**solution**](https://github.com/dhruvjagtap07/Daily-Programming-Challenge-2025/blob/main/Day3.cpp)

### [Day 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OgR1qKTZmBkNiqWXfCnpsElLJqQBQKvce7WF1R_XXA4/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given two sorted arrays arr1 of size m and arr2 of size n. Your task is to merge these two arrays into a single sorted array without using any extra space (i.e., in-place merging). The elements in arr1 should be merged first, followed by the elements of arr2, resulting in both arrays being sorted after the merge.
[**solution**](https://github.com/dhruvjagtap07/Daily-Programming-Challenge-2025/blob/main/Day4.cpp)

### [Day 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lKNcZA8OToRCwL2hqaNzYx5A2ImGHRRE6K9MQwxh580/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given an integer array arr of size n. An element is considered a leader if it is greater
 than all the elements to its right. Your task is to find all such leader elements in the array.
[**solution**](https://github.com/dhruvjagtap07/Daily-Programming-Challenge-2025/blob/main/Day5.cpp)

### [Day 6](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KMZ0FfJQE9px1mO_j6VmFXe7ueBa2-Z-nQ6BrE9G2rI/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given an integer array arr of size n. Your task is to find all the subarrays whose elements sum up to zero. A subarray is defined as a contiguous part of the array, and you must return the starting and ending indices of each subarray.
[**solution**](https://github.com/dhruvjagtap07/Daily-Programming-Challenge-2025/blob/main/Day6.cpp)

### [Day 7](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VpkYkKC07_1tUL_AsoJYi0s8G8xVP5LcQMuPOtP3yeI/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given an array height[] of non-negative integers where each element represents the height of a bar in a histogram-like structure. These bars are placed next to each other, and the width of each bar is 1 unit. When it rains, water gets trapped between the bars if there are taller bars on both the left and right of the shorter bars. The task is to calculate how much water can be trapped between these bars after the rain.
[**solution**](https://github.com/dhruvjagtap07/Daily-Programming-Challenge-2025/blob/main/Day7.cpp)

### [Day 8](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rmsjd6ZHBpNXo2dgcHo-pGPVVsHdJ8nQEDl5HrLPvY4/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given a string s that consists of multiple words separated by spaces. Your task is to reverse the order of the words in the string. Words are defined as sequences of non-space characters. The output string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, and multiple spaces between words should be reduced to a single space.
[**solution**](https://github.com/dhruvjagtap07/Daily-Programming-Challenge-2025/blob/main/Day8.cpp)

### [Day 9](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ne2Rx3CGsbipkIEHlR0xXWAoyKn69qgyPD7USIbZKjo/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given an array of strings strs[], consisting of lowercase letters. Your task is to find the longest
common prefix shared among all the strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".A common
prefix is a substring that appears at the beginning of all the strings in the array. The task is to identify
the longest such prefix that all strings share.
[**solution**](https://github.com/dhruvjagtap07/Daily-Programming-Challenge-2025/blob/main/Day9.cpp)

### [Day 10](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vLsga5LSrkePvcIcAjVIXNzxm8-ohXGyTslLarPd_m0/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given an array of strings strs[]. Your task is to group all the strings that are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. The goal is to return the grouped anagrams as a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other.
[**solution**](https://github.com/dhruvjagtap07/Daily-Programming-Challenge-2025/blob/main/Day10.cpp)

### [Day 11](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UG8x6IpG-7NM6beEtZyx4VYfWfrX3dEm1zG1t2cS5qo/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given a string s. Your task is to generate and return all possible permutations of the characters in 
the string. A permutation is a rearrangement of the characters in the string, and each character must appear 
exactly once in every permutation. If there are duplicate characters in the string, the resulting permutations
should also be unique (i.e., no repeated permutations).
[**solution**](https://github.com/dhruvjagtap07/Daily-Programming-Challenge-2025/blob/main/Day11.cpp)

### [Day 12](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NUePZz68oMD3Jyi8TT3qDIYazRL_t4jkfuw95H-T_Qs/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given a string s consisting of different types of parentheses: (), {}, and []. Your task is
to determine whether the given string is valid. A string is considered valid if:
1. Every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type.
2. The brackets are closed in the correct order. This means that a closing
   bracket must close the most recent unmatched opening bracket.
