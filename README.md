## Questions 

### [Day 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13A4_Ao-rcPtBixXnsMMDuN4ByQTIwV3dWuxmbxoJryA/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given an array arr consisting only of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The task is to sort the array in increasing order 
in linear time (i.e., O(n)) without using any extra space. This means you need to rearrange the array in-place.

### [Day 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12_bbV-jW2RakUKA1C6yTllF_npjjmnTuyHHVSD5NVj8/edit?tab=t.0):
You are given an array arr containing n-1 distinct integers. The array consists of integers taken from the
range 1 to n, meaning one integer is missing from this sequence. Your task is to find the missing integer.
